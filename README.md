# Improved log-Gaussian approximation for over-dispersed Poisson regression
R code for the Monte Carlo experiments used Murakami and Matsui (2021) Improved log-Gaussian approximation for over-dispersed Poisson regression: application to spatial analysis of COVID-19. Arxiv 2104.13588.

As explained in this paper, the proposed closed-form approximation is fast, practical, and free from the identification problem that can be severe for conventional 
Poisson regressions in case of small samples with many zeros. The Monte Carlo experiments assuming conventional Poisson regression (PoissonApprox_MCsim_case1(basic)_code.R) and Poisson additive mixed model (PoissonApprox_MCsim_case2(spatial)_code.R) demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed approximation.
